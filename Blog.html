                     <p>Recently, I obtained a pair of Viking Azura binoculars, so sparked my interest in birdwatching. After a preliminary test at my local park – where I saw some Coots, Moor Hens, Mallard Ducks, Tufted Ducks and even a Grey Heron, I journeyed farther afield, visiting Lyme Regis. </p>
                     <p>In Lyme Regis I saw lots of Black Headed Gulls and Herring Gulls, as well as a few other rarer birds: Common Chiffchaffs and Northern Wheatears.</p>
                     <p>
                        Sadly, my visit to Lyme Regis was cut short, as my family and I discovered mice in the room of the hotel we were staying at (having been woken up at 1:00AM by the sounds of scampering feet. Although I do love all furry critters, I like mice and rats much more when they are outside in the woods, rather than under my bed…
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I’m hoping to continue my birding ventures when I return to university and want to take advantage of the surrounding countryside and scenery.

                     <p>After reading Ultra-Processed People by Chris van Tulleken, I decided not to buy supermarket bread but to try baking my own. On Chris’ recommendation, I bought cooking on a bootstrap by Jack Monroe, and started off with her basic white bread recipe. This did not go very well at first – when mixing the dough, I added way too much water, resulting in a very sticky mixture which required copious amounts of flour to fix. In the end it tasted alright, although a little bland. I did not add nearly enough salt. </p>
                    
                     <p>
                        The next time I made this bread, I used less water and half a tablespoon of salt. This loaf was much more successful.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I then decided to try making wholemeal bread – I replaced half the flour with wholemeal flour. The end result was much more flavoursome than the white loaves.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        My next challenge was sourdough. I chose the BBC Good Food Sourdough Starter recipe and began. I fed my starter every day for 5 days (as the recipe stated), however on the 5th day, it still wasn’t ready. I fed it for another two days until finally a teaspoonful passed the float test – the natural yeast was active enough! It was time to make the loaf!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Although I felt like I followed the recipe to the letter, my loaf was remarkably wet, and I did not have much hope when I put it in the oven. What emerged an hour later was a lumpy bread monstrosity, which when cut revealed a cavernous inside. After this failed venture, I decided to put sourdough making on hold for a couple of weeks, and return to my good old brown loaves.

                     <p>I’ve been drawing for as long as I can remember, although I started making a real effort when I was 11. Initially, I was heavily inspired by Draw with Jazza and Tamaytka, loving their cartoony yet semi-realistic styles.

                     <p>
                        My favourite medium to work in has shifted over the years, from pencils, to watercolour, but now seems to be settling into acrylic paint. I love how it feels to put it on a page, and the wide range of colours you can easily get from mixing colours (I find blending with pencils more challenging). I also love the vibrancy of the medium, and how opaque it is after just one layer.
                     </p>
                     <p>One of my aims for the future is to improve at painting portraits, and to be able to draw complex poses from memory.</p>
